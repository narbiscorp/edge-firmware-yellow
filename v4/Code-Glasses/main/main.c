/*******************************************************************************
 * Smart Glasses Firmware v4.14.39
 *
 * Current build: ESP32-based Narbis Edge firmware with PPG heartbeat
 * detection, on-device HRV frequency-domain analysis (coherence, band
 * powers, resp peak), BLE streaming, and lens drive control. Full
 * version history in the CHANGELOG blocks below.
 *
 * PPG pipeline: PulseSensor analog on GPIO35 (ADC1_CH7), 50 Hz sampling,
 * on-device Elgendi 2013 peak detection with raw-ADC sensor-presence
 * gate (v4.13.1), periodic detector auto-refresh every 30s (v4.13.2),
 * beat/IBI/HR streaming over BLE characteristic 0xFF04.
 *
 * Coherence pipeline (v4.13.0+): rolling 120-entry IBI ring →
 * 4Hz × 256-pt grid → Hanning-windowed radix-2 FFT → VLF/LF/HF band
 * integration → LF resonance peak (single-bin) → coherence score
 * matching client's Lehrer/Vaschillo formula. Emitted on 0xFF03
 * status char as 0xF2 packet once per second.
 *
 * Dashboard v13.10+ receives raw samples, firmware detection results,
 * and firmware coherence values; displays both client-side and
 * firmware-side HRV for cross-validation.
 * 
 * Full LED control surface: strobe, static, and breathing modes.
 * All pattern timing runs on-device via gptimer ISR (strobe) and led_task
 * 10ms tick loop (breathing). BLE app only sends configuration commands.
 *
 * Three on-device programs cycled by a short magnet tap (0.3-4s):
 *   1. BREATHE        — 6 BPM sine, lens tint follows waveform (default at boot)
 *   2. BREATHE+STROBE — 10Hz strobe whose dark-phase duty is modulated by the
 *                       breathing waveform (strobe "breathes")
 *   3. STROBE         — plain 10Hz strobe, no breathing
 * Long magnet close (>=5s) still enters deep sleep.
 *
 * BLE ADVERTISING AUTO-OFF (v4.11.0, hardened in v4.11.1):
 *   To minimize idle current when the device is used standalone (hall-only,
 *   no app), the entire BLE stack is torn down after BLE_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS
 *   of no connection. v4.11.0 only called esp_ble_gap_stop_advertising(),
 *   which left the BT controller and Bluedroid stack running and still
 *   scheduling periodic housekeeping RF bursts (visible as sporadic ~1.5A
 *   spikes in current traces). v4.11.1 escalates: full teardown via
 *   esp_bluedroid_disable/deinit + esp_bt_controller_disable/deinit.
 *   Radio is completely off; no RF activity of any kind.
 *
 *   Expected usage: user opens arms (boots/wakes), has a 60-second window
 *   to connect from the app. If no connection occurs in that window, BLE
 *   tears down fully and the device continues running its current
 *   hall-selected program with the radio cold.
 *
 *   Re-arming: any hall event (tap or hold) re-initializes the BLE stack
 *   from scratch and starts advertising. Cost is ~100ms of init time,
 *   which is imperceptible between the user reaching for the magnet and
 *   then reaching for their phone to connect. A long close (>=5s) still
 *   enters deep sleep normally; on wake, BLE starts fresh.
 *
 *   While connected: timeout is disabled. On disconnect, a new 60s window
 *   starts so the user can reconnect if they want.
 *   During OTA: timeout is blocked (same pattern as sleep blocking).
 *
 *   Idle current: ~8mA during active session with BLE down (just ESP32
 *   + lens drive). During the 60s advertising window after boot/wake/
 *   disconnect, idle is ~15mA (v4.9.12 advertising config).
 * 
 * FEATURES:
 * - AC differential drive: GPIO26/GPIO27 via gptimer 100µs ISR (100Hz AC,
 *   phase-synced to strobe edges for beat-free operation)
 * - Three LED modes: STROBE, STATIC, BREATHE
 * - DDS strobe: gptimer hardware ISR, ±100µs precision, sub-Hz to 50Hz
 * - Breathing engine: cosf sine / linear, configurable BPM, ratio, holds
 * - OTA firmware updates via BLE (deferred, with write drain)
 * - Power saving: -6dBm adv / -12dBm connected, 100-200ms adv interval
 * 
 * BLE COMMANDS (multi-byte to 0xFF01):
 * 
 *   COMMON:
 *   - A2 [brightness]     Set max tint 0-100%
 *   - A4 [minutes]        Set session duration 1-60 min
 *   - A7 00               Sleep immediately
 * 
 *   MODE SWITCHING:
 *   - A5 [duty]           Enter STATIC mode at given duty 0-100%
 *   - A6 00               Enter STROBE mode
 *   - B0 00               Enter BREATHE mode
 * 
 *   STROBE PARAMS (take effect immediately):
 *   - AB [freq]           Set strobe frequency 1-50 Hz
 *   - AC [duty_pct]       Set strobe duty cycle 10-90% (% of period dark)
 * 
 *   BREATHE PARAMS (take effect immediately):
 *   - B1 [bpm]            Set breathing rate 1-30 BPM
 *   - B2 [pct]            Set inhale ratio 10-90%
 *   - B3 [val]            Set hold-at-top 0-50 (×100ms, max 5s)
 *   - B4 [val]            Set hold-at-bottom 0-50
 *   - B5 [wave]           Waveform: 0=sine, 1=linear
 * 
 *   OTA:
 *   - A8 00               Start OTA mode
 *   - A9 00               Finish OTA (validate + reboot)
 *   - AA 00               Cancel OTA
 *   - AD 01               Confirm page (write buffer to flash)
 *   - AD 00               Reject page (discard, resend)
 *
 *   NARBIS (Path B):
 *   - C1 00               Forget paired earclip + rescan (BLE central)
 *
 * LEGACY: Single byte 0x00-0xFF → static mode at byte*100/255
 * 
 * CHANGELOG Path B (replaces v4.14.39 ESP-NOW path):
 * - Glasses now connect to the Narbis earclip as a BLE central, not via
 *   Wi-Fi/ESP-NOW. The Bluedroid stack runs in dual-role mode: peripheral
 *   for the existing phone/dashboard 0xFF01..0xFF04 GATT service, central
 *   for the earclip's NARBIS_SVC. All Wi-Fi/ESP-NOW code paths and the
 *   ~28 mA continuous Wi-Fi tax are gone.
 *
 *   Pairing: on first boot the central scans for any peripheral whose
 *   advertisement carries NARBIS_SVC_UUID, picks the highest-RSSI hit,
 *   persists its MAC to NVS namespace "narbis_pair" key "earclip_mac",
 *   and connects. Subsequent boots do a directed scan for that MAC.
 *
 *   Forget + rescan: two paths.
 *     - 5 short hall-magnet taps within 2 s (recovery, no app handy).
 *     - 0xFF01 CTRL opcode 0xC1 NARBIS_FORGET (preferred, via dashboard).
 *   Both wipe NVS, drop the connection, and start a fresh general scan.
 *   Visual feedback: 3 fast lens-opacity pulses.
 *
 *   On connect: MTU exchange → service discovery → write 0x02 (GLASSES
 *   peer-role byte) to NARBIS_CHR_PEER_ROLE → subscribe to NARBIS_CHR_IBI
 *   (and optionally NARBIS_CHR_BATTERY). RAW_PPG is intentionally NOT
 *   subscribed — power waste for a stream the glasses don't display.
 *
 *   v1 dispatch: IBI notifications fall through to on_earclip_ibi() which
 *   currently only ble_log()s the event. The TODO inside is the integration
 *   point for fusing the earclip's beats into the on-device coherence IBI
 *   ring (coh_state).
 *
 *   New code lives in components/narbis_ble_central/. The component is
 *   pulled in via main/CMakeLists.txt's REQUIRES list. Protocol header
 *   and helpers come from components/narbis_protocol/, a path-add to the
 *   repo's top-level protocol/ directory (single source of truth).
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.36:
 * - System health telemetry packet. New 0xF3 binary packet emitted
 *   from ppg_task every 500ms carrying structured health data:
 *     - Uptime (seconds since boot)
 *     - Free heap (bytes, current)
 *     - Min free heap since boot (leak indicator)
 *     - PPG task stack high-water mark (words remaining)
 *     - Cumulative BLE send errors
 *     - Max tick jitter in current window (µs)
 *     - Count of ticks >25ms late in current window
 *
 *   Dashboard v13.21+ parses and displays in a System Health panel
 *   with color-coded thresholds (red/yellow/green).
 *
 *   Jitter metrics are reset at the 5-second heartbeat log boundary
 *   (existing behavior). The health packet reads without resetting,
 *   so dashboard sees "worst in current 5s window so far."
 *
 *   Minor refactor: jitter_ticks_over promoted from ppg_task local to
 *   file-scope (ppg_jitter_ticks_over) so ppg_emit_health() can read
 *   it. Semantics unchanged.
 *
 *   Packet is 20 bytes; status char MTU handles it fine (BLE default
 *   MTU 23 bytes payload minus 3 byte ATT header = 20 bytes).
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.35:
 * - Build fix. The v4.14.30 NVS persistence work used `extern volatile`
 *   forward-declarations ahead of prefs_load() so the function could
 *   reference variables defined later. But those variables were defined
 *   `static volatile` later in the file, and a prior `extern` declaration
 *   promotes the symbol to external linkage — the subsequent `static`
 *   definition then fails with:
 *     error: static declaration of 'strobe_dhz' follows non-static
 *     error: static declaration of 'breathe_bpm' follows non-static
 *     (and similar for strobe_duty_pct, breathe_inhale_pct, breathe_hold_top,
 *      breathe_hold_bot, breathe_wave)
 *
 *   Fix: deleted the extern block and moved prefs_load() to immediately
 *   after the last parameter-variable definition. Now the function sees
 *   all its targets via their direct static-volatile definitions — no
 *   forward declaration needed. No behavioral change; call sites
 *   (app_main + BLE 0xBF handler) are both well past the new location.
 *
 *   This bug affected v4.14.30 through v4.14.34 — any build of those
 *   versions would have failed the same way. User finally ran a build
 *   after accumulating those versions in sequence and saw this.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.34:
 * - BLE advertising-deadline reset now also fires on hall-tap program
 *   change. User feedback: "make sure the radio off timer 5 minute is
 *   reset from the last time a device was connected or a program change."
 *
 *   Previously the 5-minute auto-off window reset only on:
 *     - Boot (fresh window starts from power-on)
 *     - Disconnect (fresh 5min after client drops)
 *     - PPG-auto activation (fresh 5min on sensor plug-in)
 *
 *   Now also resets on:
 *     - Hall short-tap program cycle (both hall-mode and PPG-mode paths)
 *
 *   Rationale: hall interaction indicates the user is actively engaging
 *   with the device and may want to connect a phone/dashboard. Giving
 *   them the full 5-minute window from the moment they tapped avoids
 *   the "radio just turned off 10 seconds before I wanted to connect"
 *   edge case.
 *
 *   Gated on ble_stack_up && !is_connected so while connected (deadline
 *   already disabled) the reset is a no-op — no change to connected-
 *   state behavior.
 *
 *   Note: BLE program-change commands (0xB0, 0xB6, 0xB7) already happen
 *   during an active connection, so they implicitly have the radio up.
 *   No change needed there.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.33:
 * - Bug fix: on boot with sensor already connected, user was seeing
 *   1-pulse (program 1 boot indicator) then pause then 5-pulse
 *   (sensor-connected handshake). Intended behavior is to skip the
 *   1-pulse entirely when sensor detected.
 *
 *   Root cause: BOOT_INDICATOR_DELAY_MS was 3 seconds (set back in
 *   v4.14.3 when sensor gate only needed ~2 seconds). Since v4.14.20+
 *   the sustained-span sensor gate needs ~5-6 seconds to confirm, so
 *   the boot indicator was firing before the gate could suppress it.
 *
 *   Fix: BOOT_INDICATOR_DELAY_MS 3000 → 8000. PPG-auto has time to
 *   activate first (typical 6s confirm), sets boot_indicator_shown,
 *   the delayed boot-indicator check sees the flag and skips. Boot
 *   without sensor still works — 1-pulse fires 8 seconds in.
 *
 * - HALL_SHORT_MIN_MS reduced 300 → 150ms. Quicker tap-to-response
 *   for hall program cycling. Still well above the 50ms debounce
 *   floor so real electrical noise continues to be rejected.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.32:
 * - Adaptive coherence pacer. Programs 2 (COHERENCE_BREATHE) and 4
 *   (COHERENCE_BREATHE_STROBE) now auto-adjust cycle duration to
 *   match the user's detected respiration frequency. Starts at 6 BPM
 *   on program entry, then tracks the 15-second average measured
 *   resp (clamped 3-10 BPM). Cycle changes only latch at boundaries
 *   so the lens rhythm never stutters mid-breath.
 *
 *   - Data source: coh_state.resp_peak_mhz (already computed by
 *     coherence module at 1Hz).
 *   - In-range validity window: 50-167 mHz (3-10 BPM) so noise
 *     measurements get dropped, not averaged in.
 *   - New BLE command 0xB9: enable/disable (default enabled).
 *   - NVS-persisted as KEY_COH_ADAPTIVE.
 *   - Fresh ring on every PPG-auto entry.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.31:
 * - Coherence score saturation fixed. Previously the formula was:
 *     coherence = (peak_power / total_power) * 250, clamped to 100
 *   That 250x multiplier saturated the score at 100 for any peak-to-
 *   total ratio ≥ 0.40. Any steady paced breathing trivially clears
 *   0.40, so most users saw "100" throughout a session — which then
 *   pinned Coh Agreement at 0 and made difficulty adjustments feel
 *   meaningless.
 *
 *   User report: "I'm on Expert, PSD shows multiple peaks, but FW
 *   Coherence reads 100. Shouldn't it be lower?" — yes, and the
 *   saturation was why.
 *
 *   Fix: multiplier changed 250 → 100. Score now tracks the raw
 *   ratio directly in percentage points:
 *     ratio = 0.2 → score  20
 *     ratio = 0.5 → score  50
 *     ratio = 0.76 → score 76 (user's screenshot)
 *     ratio = 0.95 → score 95
 *     ratio = 1.0 → score 100 (requires ALL power in one peak)
 *
 *   This matches HeartMath's scoring convention (their 0-16 raw score
 *   times 6.25 = same 0-100 scale).
 *
 *   Existing dashboard zone thresholds (Easy 60/30, Medium 70/40,
 *   Hard 80/50, Expert 90/60) continue to work — these were already
 *   tuned to the unsaturated distribution, so they'll now actually
 *   segregate users into meaningful zones.
 *
 *   Notes:
 *   - Coh Agreement (delta vs client coherence) will now be more
 *     meaningful — if client and firmware agree on ratio they'll
 *     report the same score.
 *   - Historic session data comparability: sessions recorded prior
 *     to v4.14.31 used the 250 multiplier and will appear "higher"
 *     than equivalent post-v4.14.31 sessions. This is the right
 *     direction — older numbers were inflated.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.30:
 * - Persistent user preferences via NVS. All BLE-settable parameters
 *   now survive power cycles. On boot, saved values are restored
 *   before any task starts. On each parameter change via BLE, the
 *   value is written through to NVS (single-key commit, minimal
 *   flash wear).
 *
 *   Persisted parameters (with NVS keys):
 *     brightness           (bright)       — 0xA2
 *     session_duration_ms  (sess_min)     — 0xA4 (stored as minutes)
 *     strobe_dhz           (strob_dhz)    — 0xAB (stored as Hz)
 *     strobe_duty_pct      (strob_dty)    — 0xAC
 *     breathe_bpm          (brth_bpm)     — 0xB1
 *     breathe_inhale_pct   (brth_inh)     — 0xB2
 *     breathe_hold_top     (brth_top)     — 0xB3
 *     breathe_hold_bot     (brth_bot)     — 0xB4
 *     breathe_wave         (brth_wav)     — 0xB5
 *     coh_difficulty       (coh_diff)     — 0xB8
 *
 *   Not persisted: mode-change commands (0xA5/0xA6/0xB0/0xB6/0xB7),
 *   OTA commands, scan/reset diagnostics. These are transient session
 *   actions, not preferences.
 *
 * - New BLE command 0xBF: factory reset. Erases the entire
 *   narbis_prefs NVS namespace and immediately reloads — all
 *   parameters revert to compiled-in defaults without requiring a
 *   reboot. Dashboard exposes this as a "Reset to Defaults" button.
 *
 *   First boot ever (empty NVS) reads defaults via prefs_get_*'s
 *   fallback argument — no special-case handling needed.
 *
 *   Namespace: "narbis_prefs". All keys ≤15 chars.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.29:
 * - Replaced knee-point difficulty with gamma curve. The knee-based
 *   v4.14.28 approach created a dead zone at the bottom of coherence
 *   (Expert with start=75 meant coh below 75 gave ZERO lens response).
 *   User flagged this as nonsensical for training: "whats with all the
 *   0s on the table." They were right — operant conditioning fails
 *   when the feedback signal disappears in the range the user is
 *   trying to learn.
 *
 *   New approach: gamma-curve compression.
 *     lens_clear_pct = (coh/100) ^ gamma × 100
 *
 *   Gamma values:
 *     Easy   1.0  (linear, historical behavior)
 *     Medium 1.5
 *     Hard   2.0
 *     Expert 3.0
 *
 *   Monotonic at every coherence. No dead zones. Lens always responds
 *   to any coherence change, but higher difficulty means steeper curve
 *   (more coherence required for same visible effect).
 *
 *   Lens response at coh=50:
 *     Easy=50% | Medium=35% | Hard=25% | Expert=13%
 *   At coh=75:
 *     Easy=75% | Medium=65% | Hard=56% | Expert=42%
 *   At coh=100: all levels = 100%
 *   At coh=0:   all levels = 0%
 *
 *   Uses powf() from math.h (already included).
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.28:
 * - Bug fix: v4.14.26's coh_difficulty_table produced a non-monotonic
 *   lens opacity curve. The end-knee was moved DOWN at higher
 *   difficulty (Easy=100, Medium=70, Hard=85, Expert=95), which meant
 *   Medium actually reached fully-clear at a LOWER coherence than
 *   Easy — making Medium EASIER, not harder, in part of the range.
 *
 *   At coherence=65:
 *     Old table: Easy=65%, Medium=87.5%, Hard=43%, Expert=0%
 *                        ^^^^^ WRONG: Medium gave more clear than Easy
 *     New table: Easy=65%, Medium=53%,   Hard=30%, Expert=0%
 *                         strictly monotonic decrease
 *
 *   Fix: end-knee locked at 100 across all levels. Only the start
 *   knee moves — 0, 25, 50, 75 for Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert. This
 *   guarantees: for any coherence value, higher difficulty always
 *   gives a darker (more tinted) lens.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.27:
 * - Build fix. v4.14.26 placed coh_difficulty_table[] and coh_difficulty
 *   variable inside the coherence module near the bottom of the file,
 *   but led_task (line ~2770) and process_command (line ~3346) both
 *   live well above that location and reference these symbols. GCC
 *   errored with:
 *     error: 'coh_difficulty' undeclared (first use in this function)
 *     error: 'coh_difficulty_table' undeclared
 *     error: 'coh_difficulty_table' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-const-variable=]
 *
 *   Fix: moved the coh_difficulty_t typedef, the coh_difficulty_table[]
 *   array, and the coh_difficulty state variable to the file-top state
 *   block (right after ppg_batch_count). Same pattern as v4.14.4's
 *   g_sensor_gate_ok move and v4.14.13's ppg_batch_count move.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.26:
 * - Reverted v4.14.25's raw-score deflation and peak-window narrowing.
 *   The coherence score is now computed identically across all
 *   difficulty levels — same formula, same peak search range (bins
 *   3-9, LF band). This matches HeartMath's industry-standard approach
 *   and keeps scores comparable across sessions and against published
 *   literature.
 *
 * - Difficulty parameter (coh_difficulty, set via BLE 0xB8) now only
 *   affects the COHERENCE_LENS opacity mapping curve. Higher difficulty
 *   requires higher coherence to move the lens:
 *     Easy   (0): lens maps linearly over coh 0→100 (historical)
 *     Medium (1): lens stays dark below coh=30, fully clear at coh=70
 *     Hard   (2): lens stays dark below coh=50, fully clear at coh=85
 *     Expert (3): lens stays dark below coh=65, fully clear at coh=95
 *
 *   A user who comfortably holds coh=60 will see:
 *     Easy   → lens 60% clear
 *     Medium → lens 75% clear
 *     Hard   → lens 29% clear
 *     Expert → lens fully dark
 *
 *   This is pedagogically correct: beginners see rapid visible
 *   progress, advanced users must reach for it. But the raw COHERENCE
 *   VALUE reported to the dashboard stays the same across all levels,
 *   so progress tracking is consistent.
 *
 * - Dashboard v13.15+ additionally applies HeartMath-style zone
 *   thresholds (Low/Med/High coloring) that shift with difficulty.
 *   Same raw number, different zone boundaries.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.25:
 * - Coherence difficulty parameter added. User feedback: "coherence
 *   feels too easy to keep at 100%." Previous behavior scored any
 *   steady breathing in the LF band (0.04-0.15 Hz) highly. New
 *   behavior lets the dashboard select a difficulty level that
 *   narrows the acceptable peak-frequency window and applies a
 *   score deflation factor.
 *
 *   Difficulty levels:
 *     0 Easy (default) — peak search bins 3-9 (0.047-0.141 Hz),
 *                         score scale 1.00 (matches historical).
 *     1 Medium         — peak search bins 5-8 (0.078-0.125 Hz),
 *                         score scale 0.85. Breathing must be
 *                         between ~4.5 and 7.5 br/min.
 *     2 Hard           — peak search bins 6-7 (0.094-0.109 Hz),
 *                         score scale 0.70. Near 5.5-6.5 br/min.
 *     3 Expert         — peak locked to bin 6 (0.094 Hz), score
 *                         scale 0.55. Must breathe AT resonance.
 *
 *   Score scale deflates the computed coherence linearly, so a
 *   user who'd hit 100 on Easy will hit ~85 on Medium, ~70 on
 *   Hard, ~55 on Expert — even with identical breathing technique.
 *   The COMBINED effect of narrower window + deflation is that
 *   100 on Hard/Expert genuinely requires breathing at resonance
 *   with very clean HRV.
 *
 * - New BLE command 0xB8: set coherence difficulty (arg 0-3).
 *   Takes effect within 1 second (next coherence compute cycle).
 *
 * - Strobe frequency control (0xAB) was already present; dashboard
 *   now exposes a slider for it (see v13.14 HTML).
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.24:
 * - New BLE command 0xB7: set PPG program from dashboard.
 *     arg=0 → HEARTBEAT         (LED_MODE_PULSE_ON_BEAT)
 *     arg=1 → COHERENCE_BREATHE (6 BPM paced + coh modulation)
 *     arg=2 → COHERENCE_LENS    (direct coh → opacity)
 *     arg=3 → COHERENCE_BREATHE_STROBE
 *
 *   If sent while ppg-auto is inactive, activates it (same path as
 *   sensor-detection handshake but without the 5-pulse indicator).
 *   New-program indicator (1-4 pulses) always fires so the user can
 *   confirm the dashboard command took effect.
 *
 *   This gives the dashboard a way to change programs during a
 *   session, complementing the hall-tap cycling method.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.23:
 * - BLE_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS extended 60000 → 300000 (1 min → 5 min). User
 *   feedback: 1 minute often wasn't enough time to find the device in
 *   the phone/PC BLE menu and connect. 5 minutes matches a realistic
 *   "I'm trying to pair right now" window.
 *
 * - PPG-auto no longer exits on sensor-absence. Once the user enters
 *   training mode (gate promoted to OK for first time), they stay in
 *   training mode until either (a) session timeout, (b) long hall-
 *   hold → sleep, or (c) power cycle. Loose sensor contact, brief
 *   finger-lift, or motion artifact will no longer kick them back to
 *   BREATHE mid-session.
 *
 *   Previous behavior: PPG_ABSENCE_DEBOUNCE_S (1 second) of gate-bad
 *   triggered apply_program(saved_hall_program) + 1-pulse "restored"
 *   indicator, which was jarring when the user was still wearing the
 *   sensor and just shifted their finger.
 *
 *   Short hall-tap still works as an explicit user action to change
 *   PPG programs during training, including cycling out to a non-PPG
 *   mode if they genuinely want to abandon the session.
 *
 *   Gate itself still evaluates (its state shows up in ble_log + FW Log)
 *   but no longer drives auto-exit.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.22:
 * - Gate math fixed: now uses AVERAGE span over 5s window, not
 *   consecutive-samples counter.
 *
 *   Previous (v4.14.20/21) used a consecutive-samples counter: any
 *   single sample with span < 400 reset the good_streak to zero.
 *   That required EVERY sample for 5 seconds to be above threshold,
 *   which real PPG cannot deliver — between-beat lulls naturally
 *   produce transient low-span 500ms windows. Result: user reported
 *   "now its not detecting sensor."
 *
 *   New: 250-sample ring buffer of per-sample spans, running sum for
 *   O(1) average computation. Gate is OK if average span over the
 *   ring ≥ 400. Momentary dips and momentary spikes both get
 *   averaged out; what matters is the mean level over 5 seconds.
 *
 *   Removed: PPG_GATE_OK_N, PPG_GATE_BAD_N (streak counters).
 *   Added: PPG_GATE_WINDOW_N (ring size, 250 samples = 5 seconds
 *   at 50Hz).
 *
 *   Memory: +500 bytes for the span_ring buffer.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.21:
 * - Increased sustained-span gate timing 400ms/600ms → 5s/5s. Longer
 *   windows provide more margin against transient noise spikes and
 *   momentary finger lifts. Plug-in detection now takes 5 seconds of
 *   stable finger contact before the 5-pulse handshake fires.
 *
 * - Reduced PPG_ABSENCE_DEBOUNCE_S 3 → 1. The sensor gate itself now
 *   requires 5 seconds of sustained-bad span before flipping to not-OK,
 *   so the additional 3-second ppg_auto_check polling debounce was
 *   doubling up. Now total unplug-to-exit time is 5s (gate demote) +
 *   1s (ppg_auto poll) = ~6 seconds, instead of 8.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.20:
 * - Sensor-presence gate simplified. The hysteresis + rhythmicity
 *   approach introduced in v4.14.16-18 was overengineered and still
 *   failing to cleanly reject noise-driven false positives at boot.
 *
 *   New approach: sustained raw ADC span.
 *     - Span ≥ 400 for 20 consecutive evaluations (~400ms) → present.
 *     - Span < 400 for 30 consecutive evaluations (~600ms) → absent.
 *     - DC rail check as before — mean ∈ [300, 3900], fast unplug.
 *
 *   Rationale: observed noise floor with no sensor produces spans
 *   around 100-200 counts. Real PulseSensor produces spans well
 *   above 400 and keeps them there continuously. A single noise
 *   spike can push span above 400 momentarily but can't sustain it.
 *   The sustained counter filters out exactly that failure mode.
 *
 *   Dropped: PPG_RAW_AC_MIN, PPG_RAW_AC_MIN_STICKY (hysteresis
 *   values from v4.14.16). Replaced with PPG_GATE_SPAN_MIN,
 *   PPG_GATE_OK_N, PPG_GATE_BAD_N.
 *
 *   Note: this version is built from v4.14.17 directly, skipping the
 *   rhythmicity experiments in v4.14.18/19. EWMA smoothing from
 *   v4.14.15 and all other v4.14.x features are retained.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.17:
 * - DEFAULT_SESSION_MIN bumped 10 → 30 minutes. Session timer now
 *   runs 30 minutes from boot (or from PPG-auto entry per v4.14.1).
 *   Can still be overridden at runtime via BLE session-duration command.
 *
 *   Comment block in ppg_auto_check updated to stop hard-coding "10 min"
 *   in prose — references DEFAULT_SESSION_MIN instead so future tweaks
 *   don't require chasing comment copies.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.16:
 * - Bug fix: sensor-presence gate flapping ok ↔ disconnected every
 *   ~1-2 seconds during normal finger contact. Each flap reset the
 *   detector state and cleared the coherence IBI ring, making firmware
 *   HRV and coherence values unstable.
 *
 *   Symptom log:
 *     gate: sensor disconnected (raw out of range)
 *     gate: sensor present
 *     gate: sensor disconnected (raw out of range)
 *     gate: sensor present
 *     ... every 1-2 seconds, while raw=1449 and beats flowing
 *
 *   Root cause: the gate's AC peak-to-peak threshold (200) was measured
 *   over a 500ms ADC stats window. At HR around 60 BPM, one heartbeat
 *   cycle is 1 second. If a stats window happened to fall between two
 *   beats (all diastole), the AC p-p could drop below 200 even with
 *   the sensor correctly worn, tripping the gate out of OK.
 *
 *   Fix: hysteresis. Added PPG_RAW_AC_MIN_STICKY = 80 as the AC
 *   threshold for STAYING in OK state. Entering OK still requires
 *   the strict PPG_RAW_AC_MIN = 200 so spurious low-amplitude noise
 *   can't trigger a false connect. Real unplugs still detected
 *   immediately via the DC-range check which isn't hysterized.
 *
 *   Effect: no more per-cycle flapping. Gate holds once established
 *   unless the sensor is genuinely unplugged (DC rails) or the AC
 *   drops to pure noise levels (below 80 p-p).
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.15:
 * - Added EWMA smoothing to PPG Program 3 (COHERENCE_LENS).
 *
 *   Problem: coh_state.coherence updates at 1Hz inside coherence_task
 *   and can step by 10-30 points between recalculations. Program 3
 *   reads this value every 10ms in led_task, so the lens opacity was
 *   hard-stepping once per second — visibly choppy.
 *
 *   Fix: exponentially-weighted moving average on the coherence read,
 *   running at the 10ms led_task rate. Alpha = 0.005 gives a ~2s time
 *   constant. Transitions now glide instead of step. Behavior:
 *     - coh steps 0 → 50: lens reaches 32 in 2s, 43 in 4s, 47 in 6s
 *     - coh bouncing ±5 around mean: lens barely moves
 *     - coh steady: lens steady
 *
 *   On program entry, the smoothed value snaps to the current live
 *   coherence (no 2s ramp-up artifact on every entry).
 *
 *   Only Program 3 gets the smoothing — programs 2 and 4 are already
 *   dominated by the 6 BPM breathing waveform (10-second cycle), which
 *   is much slower than the coherence update cadence, so they're
 *   smooth naturally. Raw coh_state.coherence stays unsmoothed so
 *   dashboard display and the 0xF2 status packet continue to reflect
 *   the true per-second value.
 *
 *   Tunable: COH_ALPHA constant in the led_task LED_MODE_COHERENCE_LENS
 *   branch. Raise (e.g. 0.01) for faster response, lower (e.g. 0.002)
 *   for even smoother but laggier response.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.14:
 * - Bug fix: spurious PPG-auto entry at boot with no sensor connected.
 *
 *   Symptom: boot in production → enters "sensor connected" handshake
 *   (5-pulse indicator), switches to HEARTBEAT mode, pauses, exits
 *   after ~3 seconds with a 1-pulse indicator ("restored program 1"),
 *   resumes BREATHE.
 *
 *   Root cause: g_sensor_gate_ok defaulted to true at file-top, and
 *   ppg_sensor_looks_present returned true during ADC warm-up
 *   (first ~100ms before 5 samples accumulated). ppg_auto_check runs
 *   at 1Hz and saw gate=true for two consecutive ticks before the
 *   first real ADC reading flipped it to false. 2 ticks = debounce
 *   threshold → PPG-auto activates. Then real data arrives, gate goes
 *   false, 3-second absence debounce fires, PPG-auto exits.
 *
 *   Fix (two lines of defense):
 *     1. g_sensor_gate_ok default changed true → false. Conservative
 *        "no sensor until proven otherwise."
 *     2. ppg_sensor_looks_present warm-up return changed true → false.
 *        Same conservative stance when we don't have enough data.
 *
 *   Either fix alone would close the race, but both together make
 *   the boot state unambiguous.
 *
 *   Also: ble_log message at gate OK transition updated from
 *   "sensor reconnected" to "sensor present" — reflects that the
 *   first OK transition at boot is a first-time connect, not a
 *   reconnect after disconnect.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.13:
 * - Build fix: ppg_batch_count was declared inside the PPG module at
 *   file bottom (line ~4308), but v4.14.9's disconnect handler in
 *   gatts_event_handler (line ~3439) referenced it. GCC errored:
 *     error: 'ppg_batch_count' undeclared (first use in this function)
 *
 *   Same pattern as v4.14.4's g_sensor_gate_ok fix: moved the
 *   definition to the file-top state block (right after g_sensor_gate_ok)
 *   so all users see it. ppg_batch[] buffer and ppg_batch_base_ts
 *   stay where they were — they're only used by the batch functions
 *   in the PPG module so no forward-visibility problem.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.12:
 * - Removed LCD deadzone compensation from duty→raw mapping. Previous
 *   firmware assumed the lens had a hardware deadzone at raw 0-400
 *   (lens doesn't respond until raw ≥ 400), so the mapping special-
 *   cased duty=0 → raw=0 and then jumped to raw=400 at duty=1. This
 *   produced a visible "snap" when fading into or out of clear —
 *   the lens smoothly swept from tinted down to ~raw=406, then
 *   abruptly dropped to raw=0.
 *
 *   User report: "when fading clear, lens is semi-tinted then
 *   noticeably shifts to clear. Same on fade dark." The deadzone
 *   no longer exists on current hardware, so the compensation was
 *   actively causing the artifact it was written to hide.
 *
 *   Now: straight linear map, duty 0-100 → raw 0-1023.
 *     duty=0   → raw=0
 *     duty=50  → raw=511
 *     duty=100 → raw=1023
 *
 *   Effect: smooth continuous fades, no zero-crossing snap. Lens
 *   may feel slightly less responsive at the lowest duty values
 *   (duty 1-5% now produce raw 10-51, which were previously raw
 *   406-431). If the lens is reporting "dead below ~5%" on new
 *   hardware too, we can add a minimum raw threshold back — but
 *   try without it first.
 *
 *   LCD_DEADZONE_RAW and PWM_MAX_RAW defines are retained for
 *   reference but no longer gate the mapping.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.11:
 * - New PPG program: COHERENCE_LENS (Program 3). Direct coherence →
 *   lens opacity mapping, no breathing waveform, no strobe. Linear
 *   inverse: higher coherence = clearer lens. Intent is the simplest
 *   possible biofeedback signal for users who want steady reward
 *   rather than a pacer rhythm.
 *
 *   Mapping: effective_duty = brightness × (100 - coh) / 100
 *     coh=0   → duty=100 (fully dark)
 *     coh=50  → duty=50
 *     coh=100 → duty=0 (fully clear)
 *
 * - PPG program list reordered to put COHERENCE_LENS in position 3,
 *   and COHERENCE_BREATHE_STROBE bumped to program 4. New order:
 *     Program 1: HEARTBEAT               (pulse-on-beat)
 *     Program 2: COHERENCE_BREATHE       (6 BPM, coh-modulated)
 *     Program 3: COHERENCE_LENS          (direct coh→opacity) NEW
 *     Program 4: COHERENCE_BREATHE_STROBE (was program 3)
 *
 *   PPG_PROG_COUNT bumped 3 → 4. The new indicator pulse counts on
 *   hall-tap program advance reflect the new ordering:
 *     Program 1: 1 pulse
 *     Program 2: 2 pulses
 *     Program 3: 3 pulses
 *     Program 4: 4 pulses
 *
 * - New LED mode LED_MODE_COHERENCE_LENS (= 7) added to led_mode_t.
 *   led_task handles it in a tiny branch just reading coh_state.coherence
 *   and writing effective_duty each 10ms tick. Strobe ISR doesn't need
 *   to know about this mode since it's not a strobe mode.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.10:
 * - Bug fix: PPG Program 3 (COHERENCE_BREATHE_STROBE) lens was stuck
 *   clear. The strobe ISR branch checked for LED_MODE_STROBE or
 *   LED_MODE_BREATHE_STROBE only. COHERENCE_BREATHE_STROBE was added
 *   as mode 6 in v4.14.0 but the reviewer added it to ppg_apply_program
 *   and the led_task coherence-breathe waveform math without updating
 *   the actual strobe DDS in the drive_timer ISR. Result: led_mode
 *   set to 6, strobe_start() called, but effective_duty never written
 *   by the ISR → lens stays clear forever.
 *
 *   Fix:
 *     - drive_timer_cb ISR: outer enclosing if() now includes
 *       LED_MODE_COHERENCE_BREATHE_STROBE.
 *     - Same ISR: inner scaling branch now covers both BREATHE_STROBE
 *       and COHERENCE_BREATHE_STROBE. Both use breathe_frac_q8 to
 *       scale dark-phase duty. For COHERENCE_BREATHE_STROBE,
 *       breathe_frac_q8 is already modulated by coherence in led_task,
 *       so strobe intensity inherits that modulation automatically.
 *     - strobe_update() and led_task boot conditional: same addition
 *       for consistency, in case of future BLE-issued mode changes
 *       or boot directly into that mode.
 *
 *   Bug was latent since v4.14.0 but never triggered because PPG-auto
 *   was disabled in test builds (TEST_MODE=1). First real production
 *   test with sensor exercising all three PPG programs exposed it.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.9:
 * - PPG streaming batched from 1 sample/packet to 10 samples/packet.
 *   Goal: reduce BLE conn event rate 10× when a client is subscribed,
 *   which brings ~60mA connected-with-sensor draw down toward the
 *   ~15mA baseline (processing without radio traffic).
 *
 *   Background: Polar H10 samples ECG at 130Hz internally but packs
 *   73 samples per BLE notification, emitting ~2 packets/second. BLE
 *   conn events are the dominant continuous radio cost, so batching
 *   is the correct architecture for continuous sensor streaming.
 *
 *   New packet format (0x03):
 *     [0x03] [N:u8] [base_ts:u32] [sample × N]
 *       sample = [raw:u16][idx:u16][flags:u8][ibi:u16][bpm:u8]  (8B)
 *
 *   For N=10: 6 header + 80 sample = 86 bytes per packet. Emitted
 *   every ~200ms (10 samples / 50Hz). Old format would have been
 *   10 × 13 = 130 bytes across 10 separate conn events. Smaller AND
 *   10× fewer events.
 *
 *   Per-sample timestamp reconstruction on the dashboard side:
 *     sample[i].ts = base_ts + i × 20ms  (nominal 50Hz spacing)
 *   No per-sample dt because at 50Hz with median oversampling the
 *   nominal interval is accurate enough for HRV and visualization.
 *
 *   DASHBOARD CHANGES REQUIRED:
 *     - New parser for 0x03 packets (existing 0x02 parser can be kept
 *       for backcompat if ever flashing older firmware)
 *     - Beat detection / coherence still fed per-sample via extracted
 *       samples from each batch — no logic change beyond the parser
 *
 *   Batch is flushed:
 *     - When it hits 10 samples (normal path)
 *     - On disconnect (reset, discard pending)
 *   No flush on subscribe — first batch after subscribe starts
 *   clean and fills up in 200ms.
 *
 *   No flush on beat-detected: beats are carried in each sample's
 *   flags field, so dashboard sees them within 200ms. That's fine
 *   for coherence (already 1Hz updates) and heart rate (1Hz display).
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.8:
 * - Pre-delay bumped 1000ms → 2000ms (2 seconds of clear before first pulse).
 * - New 1-second post-delay after the last pulse, before the normal
 *   program resumes. Applies to every indicator trigger.
 *
 *   Full indicator timing is now:
 *     2s clear → (count × 1.5s pulses) → 1s clear → program resumes
 *
 *   Program 1 (1 pulse):  2s + 1.5s + 1s = 4.5 seconds total
 *   Program 2 (2 pulses): 2s + 3.0s + 1s = 6.0 seconds total
 *   Program 3 (3 pulses): 2s + 4.5s + 1s = 7.5 seconds total
 *
 *   For indicators with explicit hold_ms > 0 (sensor-connected handshake
 *   uses 3000ms), the post-delay stacks: hold = hold_ms + POST_DELAY_MS.
 *
 *   Sensor handshake: 2s + (5 × 1.5s) + 3s hold + 1s post = 13.5 seconds.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.7:
 * - Revert the polarity inversion added in v4.14.6. I had incorrectly
 *   assumed the hardware mapping was reversed based on a user comment,
 *   but tracing through pwm1_set_isr/pwm2_set_isr + duty_to_raw_isr
 *   confirms: effective_duty=0 → both PWM outputs low → no voltage
 *   across electrochromic cell → CLEAR. effective_duty=100 → one PWM
 *   channel drives raw=1023, other drives 1 → voltage applied → DARK.
 *
 *   So v4.14.5's math was correct: `duty = frac × 100` produces
 *   0→100→0 which IS clear→dark→clear. The reason user saw
 *   "indicator works but inverted" in v4.14.5 was most likely something
 *   else (perhaps BREATHE happened to be near its dark phase when the
 *   indicator fired, making the indicator's clear baseline look like
 *   a "light pulse" against the dark surrounding).
 *
 *   v4.14.7 also fixes the baseline returns for pre-delay and post-pulse
 *   hold: both now return 0 (clear) again, matching the correct polarity.
 *
 *   Slow 1.5s pulse and 1s pre-delay from v4.14.6 are RETAINED.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.6:
 * - Indicator polarity reversed. On this hardware effective_duty=0 is
 *   dark and effective_duty=100 is clear (opposite of what my earlier
 *   comments assumed). The indicator now:
 *     baseline    = 100 (clear)
 *     pulse peak  = 0   (dark)
 *   Visually: clear lens, fade TO dark in the middle of pulse, fade
 *   BACK to clear. User sees a dark pulse on a clear background, which
 *   is what was asked for.
 *
 * - Pulse duration bumped 1000ms → 1500ms for a more noticeable slow
 *   fade. Each pulse is now 0.75s ramp-to-dark + 0.75s ramp-to-clear.
 *   Count timing: N pulses take roughly N × 1.5 seconds.
 *
 * - New 1-second pre-delay before first pulse. Fires on every trigger
 *   event (hall tap, ppg-auto activation, boot-after-delay). Gives the
 *   user a moment to register "I pressed the magnet" before the
 *   indicator starts counting. During pre-delay the lens is held at
 *   CLEAR (duty=100), so transition looks like: normal program →
 *   fade to clear → 1s clear hold → pulse count starts.
 *
 *   Side effect: pre-delay also suppresses strobe ISR (indicator_is_active
 *   returns true) so during pre-delay the lens is fully and stably clear,
 *   not flickering with strobe.
 *
 * - indicator_is_active() updated to include pre-delay window for the
 *   strobe-ISR mask.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.5:
 * - Indicator scale fix. Was writing 0-255 byte values to effective_duty,
 *   which is actually a 0-100 percent. The `× 2.55` conversion from PCT
 *   to "byte range" was wrong — meant indicator ramped to 255 (clamped
 *   to 100) almost instantly and stayed there for most of the pulse
 *   duration. Now writes 0-100 directly. Pulse shape is a proper
 *   triangular envelope.
 *
 * - Strobe ISR now defers to indicator. Programs 2 (BREATHE_STROBE) and
 *   3 (STROBE) call strobe_start() in apply_program(), which engages the
 *   100µs gptimer ISR that writes effective_duty from strobe DDS state.
 *   That ISR was overwriting the indicator envelope thousands of times
 *   per second, making the pulse invisible on program 2/3.
 *   Fix: ISR checks indicator_is_active() and skips the effective_duty
 *   write when the indicator is running. AC alternation still runs.
 *   When indicator releases, strobe DDS picks up cleanly from its
 *   existing accumulator state.
 *
 * - New helper indicator_is_active() — tiny inline function that returns
 *   true while pulses are playing OR during post-pulse hold. Called from
 *   the ISR (fast path) and could be called from other code if needed.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.4:
 * - Build fix. v4.14.1 introduced ppg_auto_check() which references
 *   g_sensor_gate_ok, but that variable was defined deep in the PPG
 *   module far BELOW ppg_auto_check's location in the file. GCC caught
 *   it:
 *       error: 'g_sensor_gate_ok' undeclared (first use in this function)
 *
 *   Fix: moved the definition of g_sensor_gate_ok up to the file-top
 *   state block (near boot_indicator_shown), so all users see it
 *   regardless of their position in the file. No semantic change — still
 *   a static volatile bool with same initial value.
 *
 * - Deprecation warning fix: esp_pm_config_esp32_t → esp_pm_config_t.
 *   ESP-IDF 5+ renamed the struct; old name still works but generates
 *   a warning. Trivial rename, no behavior change.
 *
 * - Remaining deprecation warning (legacy ADC driver: driver/adc.h)
 *   left alone for now. Migration to esp_adc/adc_oneshot.h is a bigger
 *   refactor of ppg_read_oversampled and the ADC scan diagnostic. Non-
 *   fatal warning. Address separately.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.3:
 * - Boot indicator delayed 3 seconds, suppressed if PPG-auto activates
 *   first. Previously booting with sensor already connected showed:
 *     1 pulse (boot program 1) → brief BREATHE → 5 pulses (sensor
 *     handshake) → 3s hold → HEARTBEAT
 *   Confusing because "program 1 indicator" is meaningless when the
 *   sensor is about to hijack the program slot anyway.
 *
 *   Now booting with sensor connected shows just:
 *     (3s of current default program) → 5 pulses → 3s hold → HEARTBEAT
 *
 *   Booting without sensor shows (unchanged user experience):
 *     (3s of current program) → 1 pulse → continues in program 1
 *
 *   Implementation: boot indicator is deferred to a due-tick check in
 *   led_task's main loop. ppg_auto_check sets the shared boot_indicator_shown
 *   flag when activating, which suppresses the boot indicator. Flag is
 *   volatile, shared between led_task (reader) and coherence_task (writer
 *   via ppg_auto_check).
 *
 *   The 3-second delay matches PPG_PRESENCE_DEBOUNCE_S (2) + a 1-second
 *   safety margin for first gate scan to stabilize. Tunable via
 *   BOOT_INDICATOR_DELAY_MS constant.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.2:
 * - Visual program indicator via slow fade-dark pulses.
 *
 *   Indicator fires on every program change (boot, hall short-tap advance,
 *   ppg-auto entry/exit) showing the new program as a count of pulses:
 *
 *     Hall programs:
 *       Program 1 (BREATHE)        → 1 pulse
 *       Program 2 (BREATHE_STROBE) → 2 pulses
 *       Program 3 (STROBE)         → 3 pulses
 *
 *     PPG programs:
 *       PPG 1 (HEARTBEAT)          → 1 pulse
 *       PPG 2 (COHERENCE_BREATHE)  → 2 pulses
 *       PPG 3 (COH BREATHE+STROBE) → 3 pulses
 *
 *     Sensor-connected handshake (ppg-auto entry):
 *       5 pulses + 3s clear hold, then normal PPG_PROG_HEARTBEAT starts.
 *
 *   Pulse shape: 0.5s fade-in to fully tinted + 0.5s fade-out to clear.
 *   Total = 1 second per pulse, so count equals seconds.
 *
 *   Indicator state lives in a tiny struct (3 words). Implementation:
 *   indicator_tick() called first in led_task each 10ms tick; if it
 *   returns a duty value (>= 0), led_task applies it directly to
 *   effective_duty and skips the normal program computation for that
 *   tick. When pulses + hold complete, indicator_tick() returns -1 and
 *   control falls through to the normal program as usual.
 *
 *   Strobe note: the indicator writes effective_duty directly, which the
 *   strobe ISR also reads. During indicator pulses the strobe is
 *   effectively overridden — pulses are clean even in strobe modes.
 *   Strobe resumes automatically on indicator release.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.1:
 * - PPG-auto entry now resets both the session timer and the BLE idle
 *   deadline. Matches intended UX: plug sensor in, 10-minute biofeedback
 *   session starts fresh, phone/PC has 60 seconds to connect, otherwise
 *   radio drops off (session keeps running silently). Short hall tap
 *   re-arms BLE — existing v4.11.0 behavior unchanged.
 *
 *   Before this change, the 10-min session timer and 60s BLE idle were
 *   both anchored to boot time. Plugging in the sensor 5 minutes after
 *   power-on gave you a 5-minute session — confusing and short.
 *
 *   The actual 60s auto-off → radio-down path was already fully wired
 *   in v4.11.0; all we do here is reset the anchor timestamps at the
 *   moment PPG-auto activates.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.14.0:
 * - TEST_MODE flag replaces PPG_TEST_BUILD as the primary one-line toggle
 *   at the top of the build section. PPG_TEST_BUILD is kept as an alias
 *   (#define PPG_TEST_BUILD TEST_MODE) so every existing `#if PPG_TEST_BUILD`
 *   block in the file works unchanged. Hall sensor code itself was never
 *   removed — just guarded — so flipping TEST_MODE to 0 brings back the
 *   full v4.10.0 hall behavior: short tap (0.3–4s) = advance program,
 *   5s hold = deep sleep.
 *
 * - PPG auto-mode: the sensor-presence gate on GPIO35 (physical pin 11)
 *   that v4.13.1 added for detection gating now also drives a mode switch.
 *   When the PulseSensor is plugged in and the gate admits samples stably
 *   for 2 seconds, the device overrides the current hall program and
 *   enters a PPG-specific program list:
 *     PPG Program 1 — HEARTBEAT          : LED_MODE_PULSE_ON_BEAT
 *     PPG Program 2 — COHERENCE BREATHE  : 6 BPM 40/60 sine, opacity
 *                                          modulated by coherence (more
 *                                          coherence → lighter lens,
 *                                          down to COH_DUTY_FLOOR_PCT)
 *     PPG Program 3 — COHERENCE BR+STRB  : same as #2 but the modulated
 *                                          fraction scales strobe dark
 *                                          duty instead of flat tint
 *
 *   Short hall tap cycles within the PPG program list while sensor is
 *   connected. On sustained unplug (3 seconds NOT-OK) the previously
 *   running hall program is restored. PPG auto-mode is itself gated by
 *   !PPG_TEST_BUILD so bench work isn't hijacked.
 *
 * - Two new LED modes: LED_MODE_COHERENCE_BREATHE and
 *   LED_MODE_COHERENCE_BREATHE_STROBE. Breathing math for these is
 *   hardcoded locally in led_task (not driven by the global breathe_*
 *   vars) so BLE B1/B2 tweaks to those globals don't drift the resonant
 *   pacer. Coherence read from coh_state.coherence — atomic u8, safe for
 *   the 10ms led_task polling loop.
 *
 * - Tunables (all near top of file for one-line tweaks):
 *     COH_DUTY_FLOOR_PCT       20    — duty scale at coh=100
 *     PPG_PRESENCE_DEBOUNCE_S  2     — enter ppg-auto after N stable OK sec
 *     PPG_ABSENCE_DEBOUNCE_S   3     — exit ppg-auto after N stable NOT-OK sec
 *
 *   Re-reading: a previous v4.13.0 CHANGELOG note said "future v4.14.0
 *   will tie the coherence value into a LED_MODE_COHERENCE_PACER that
 *   modulates lens tint by real-time coherence score." This release is
 *   that feature, plus the strobe variant and the auto-enter-on-plug-in
 *   UX layer.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.13.8:
 * - Coherence denominator reverted to VLF+LF+HF. My v4.13.5 change to
 *   "full spectrum total" was based on misreading the client code.
 *   Actually reading dashboard v13.10 reveals:
 *
 *     const psd = lombScargle(times, centered, freqs);  // Lomb-Scargle, not FFT
 *     freqs = 0.003..0.4 Hz, 200 points                  // only this range
 *     for(i=0..199) { tp += psd[i]*df; ... }             // tp over 0.003-0.4 only
 *
 *   Client never includes frequencies above 0.4 Hz in tp. My v4.13.5-v4.13.7
 *   firmware summed bins 1-127 (covering up to 2 Hz Nyquist), making the
 *   denominator 2-3× too large and driving coherence systematically low
 *   (FW=3 vs client=12 in Devon's v4.13.7 test).
 *
 *   Correct denominator is bins 1-25 (0.016-0.391 Hz, essentially the
 *   Task Force VLF+LF+HF total). Same total used for coherence and for
 *   the displayed "Total Power" field.
 *
 *   Note: client uses Lomb-Scargle on irregular IBI series; firmware uses
 *   FFT on uniformly-resampled series. These methods produce similar but
 *   not identical PSDs. Expect residual ±5 coherence agreement even with
 *   all other bugs fixed. Porting Lomb-Scargle to firmware is possible
 *   but high CPU/memory cost for marginal improvement.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.13.7:
 * - Coherence peak window narrowed from ±1 bin (3 bins) to single bin.
 *   Client code:
 *     if(Math.abs(freqs[i]-resPeakF)<=0.015) resP+=psd[i]*df;
 *   With df = 4/256 = 0.015625 Hz, adjacent bins are 0.015625 Hz from
 *   the peak — GREATER than 0.015, so excluded. Client's effective
 *   window is just the peak bin itself. My v4.13.4-v4.13.6 firmware
 *   summed ±1 bin (3 bins total), making the numerator 2-3× too large
 *   and inflating coherence — Devon saw FW=100 vs client=44. Fixed.
 *
 *   This is the third coherence-math iteration. For posterity, the
 *   cumulative formula evolution was:
 *     v4.13.0-3:  ratio² × 250 × N (single bin, squared, × 256)
 *     v4.13.4:    ratio × 250       (±1 bin window, Task Force denom)
 *     v4.13.5-6:  ratio × 250       (±1 bin window, full-spectrum denom)
 *     v4.13.7:    ratio × 250       (single bin, full-spectrum denom)
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.13.6:
 * - Bumped PPG_RAW_AC_MIN from 10 to 200. Field test with sensor
 *   plugged in but no finger confirmed the PulseSensor amplifier
 *   self-oscillates, producing ~150-200 code p-p swing that looked
 *   enough like signal to clear the too-loose gate. Beats were
 *   being emitted with wildly varying IBIs (400-1200ms) which then
 *   inflated coherence via bogus LF content.
 *
 *   Real finger pulses produce 300-1000+ code swings — there's a
 *   clear discrimination line. 200 catches no-finger amplifier noise
 *   while leaving margin for weak-contact cases.
 *
 *   If weak-but-valid pulses get rejected, can lower to 150 or add a
 *   secondary discriminator (e.g. recent IBI coefficient-of-variation
 *   check to reject noise-beat distributions while accepting real
 *   weak-but-consistent pulses).
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.13.5:
 * - Coherence denominator fix. Client computes tp as sum of psd over
 *   ALL frequency bins (0 to Nyquist), not just VLF+LF+HF. On noisy
 *   sessions, bins above 0.4 Hz carry substantial energy from ectopic
 *   beats, detection jitter, and interpolation artifacts — energy that
 *   dilutes the "peak concentration" ratio and correctly reduces
 *   coherence. Firmware was excluding all that energy, making coherence
 *   look artificially high (Devon saw FW=100 vs client=30 on real data).
 *   Now uses full-spectrum total for coherence while keeping Task Force
 *   VLF+LF+HF for the displayed "Total Power" field.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.13.4:
 * - Coherence math now matches client (Lehrer/Vaschillo LF resonance
 *   method, as implemented in dashboard v13.10). Two bugs in one:
 *
 *     1. Was computing ratio² × 250. Client computes ratio × 250.
 *        Squaring made the score far too low for typical non-paced
 *        breathing — a ratio of 0.13 (reasonable for normal HRV)
 *        produced firmware=4 vs client=19 in field testing.
 *
 *     2. Was using single-bin peak power. Client sums power across
 *        ±1 bin window around peak (captures the peak's shoulders).
 *        Real peaks span 2-3 bins at our 0.0156 Hz resolution;
 *        single-bin systematically under-reports.
 *
 *   Both fixed. Firmware coherence should now land within ~1-2
 *   points of client. Coh Agreement metric validates.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.13.3:
 * - Surface actual CPU frequency in FW Log heartbeat. Previously the
 *   boot-time "CPU clock: XXMHz" message used ESP_LOGI which only
 *   reaches UART, not the BLE FW Log tab where we actually look.
 *   Also, that message fires at boot before BLE is even up, so it
 *   wouldn't reach a dashboard client anyway.
 *   Now the 5-second heartbeat line includes cpu=NNMHz sourced from
 *   rtc_clk_cpu_freq_get_config(). You'll see it within 5s of
 *   connecting. If it says 80MHz you're getting the power savings;
 *   if it says 160MHz or 240MHz sdkconfig changes didn't take.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.13.2:
 * - Coherence formula fix. v4.13.0-v4.13.1 had `coherence = ratio² × 250
 *   × COH_GRID_N` which made every value 256× too large and saturated
 *   at 100. Python simulation (which validated the algorithm) used just
 *   × 250 — firmware now matches. Expect Coh Agreement with client to
 *   land within a few points.
 *
 * - Reset function fix. ppg_reset_detector() did not reset
 *   ppg_sample_count, so after manual/BLE reset the warmup period
 *   didn't re-engage. Under-filled MA_beat vs filled MA_peak produced
 *   a burst of false positives for ~660ms after every reset —
 *   effectively making the "Reset FW Detector" button worse than
 *   useless. Now forces full 1s warmup re-engage after reset.
 *
 * - Periodic auto-reset every 30s. Over long noisy sessions (motion
 *   artifact on connected sensor, not caught by gate since signal
 *   has plausible DC+AC), the adaptive MA_beat baseline drifts up to
 *   accommodate the noise floor. Eventually any tiny burst clears
 *   threshold and produces false beats. Hard-resetting every 30s
 *   gives the baseline a fresh start and prevents this drift.
 *   Auto-reset skipped if in_block to avoid interrupting real beats.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.13.1:
 * - Sensor-presence gate. Field data confirmed the failure mode: with
 *   PulseSensor plugged into the board but not on skin, raw ADC sits
 *   in a plausible midrail range with ~200 code p-p swing (electrical
 *   noise from nearby traces). The squared-bandpass signal clears
 *   PPG_MIN_MA_BEAT=4.0 easily, so ghost beats are emitted with
 *   nonsense IBIs (600-1900ms jumping around, fake HR 40bpm etc).
 *
 *   Fix: gate ppg_detect on raw ADC signature via the existing
 *   adc_stats_ring (25-sample 500ms window). A physically-connected
 *   sensor pressed against skin holds near midrail with a bounded
 *   and consistent pulse envelope. Parameters chosen from observed
 *   data (raw=0 rail-low on disconnect, raw ~1800-2100 no-skin,
 *   raw ~1700-2200 with pulse):
 *     PPG_RAW_DC_MIN = 300   (catches rail-low disconnect)
 *     PPG_RAW_DC_MAX = 3900  (catches rail-high disconnect)
 *     PPG_RAW_AC_MIN = 10    (catches flat floats; 10 leaves margin
 *                             for weak contact with loose fit)
 *   Dropped the AC_MAX upper bound from the reviewer's suggestion —
 *   motion rejection is a separate concern and the proposed 3000
 *   threshold would never fire in practice.
 *
 *   On gate fail: ppg_in_block, ppg_above_run, and ppg_last_beat_ms
 *   all cleared so reconnection starts cleanly. Also clears the
 *   coherence IBI ring so pre/post-disconnect beats don't glue together
 *   into a nonsense time series for frequency-domain analysis.
 *
 *   PPG_MIN_MA_BEAT retained as secondary check (catches the "raw
 *   looks plausible but no pulse energy" case).
 *
 *   New ble_log field 'gate' in heartbeat line shows whether gate is
 *   currently admitting samples.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.13.0:
 * - MAJOR: Coherence & frequency-domain HRV now computed on-device.
 *   Previously all frequency-domain math (coherence, VLF/LF/HF bands,
 *   resp freq) was dashboard-side only. This created two problems:
 *   (a) values lagged during browser/BLE issues, (b) can't drive lens
 *   modulation from coherence without firmware knowing the score.
 *
 *   New architecture:
 *     - Rolling 120-entry IBI ring buffer (~2min at 60bpm)
 *     - coherence_task @ priority 4, fires once per second
 *     - Resamples IBI series onto 4Hz × 256 sample grid (64s window)
 *     - Detrend + Hanning window + 256-pt radix-2 FFT
 *     - Integrates VLF (0.003-0.04 Hz), LF (0.04-0.15 Hz),
 *       HF (0.15-0.4 Hz) band powers
 *     - Finds LF resonance peak
 *     - Computes coherence = peak² / total² × 250, clamped 0-100
 *     - Emits new 0xF2 status packet with all values
 *
 *   Self-contained FFT (Cooley-Tukey radix-2) — no esp-dsp dependency,
 *   so build system untouched. At 80MHz CPU a 256-pt FFT takes ~3ms.
 *   Coherence task total ~5ms per second = negligible CPU.
 *
 *   Memory: ~5KB static (IBI ring + FFT bufs + Hanning precompute).
 *
 *   Values emitted in 0xF2 packet (18 bytes):
 *     [0xF2][coherence u8][resp_peak u16 mHz][vlf u16][lf u16][hf u16]
 *     [total u16][lf_norm u8][hf_norm u8][lf_hf u16 fp8.8][n_ibis u8]
 *     [reserved u16]
 *
 *   Dashboard v13.10+ will parse and display. Future v4.14.0 will
 *   tie the coherence value into a LED_MODE_COHERENCE_PACER that
 *   modulates lens tint by real-time coherence score.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.12.9:
 * - CPU frequency dropped 240MHz → 80MHz for ~20mA power savings.
 *   Workload (50Hz PPG detection) uses <1% CPU at 80MHz so no perf
 *   hit. BLE requires 80MHz minimum APB clock so we can't go lower.
 *
 *   Runtime approach: attempts esp_pm_configure if CONFIG_PM_ENABLE
 *   is set, falls back to rtc_clk_cpu_freq_set_config direct call
 *   otherwise. If neither works (verify via "CPU clock: 80MHz" log
 *   line at boot), set CONFIG_ESP32_DEFAULT_CPU_FREQ_MHZ=80 in
 *   sdkconfig as a guaranteed boot-time setting.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.12.8:
 * - Power reduction. v4.12.5 tightened BLE connection interval to
 *   7.5-15ms for throughput, but this drove average current from
 *   ~40mA to ~100mA (radio waking 100×/sec instead of 5×/sec).
 *   With dashboard v13.8+ smoothing buffer absorbing bursty delivery,
 *   we can back off the interval. New 20-30ms with latency=1 should
 *   land around 50-60mA average while still giving 3-6× better
 *   throughput than the v4.12.4 baseline.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.12.7:
 * - Build fix. v4.12.6 had ppg_reset_detector() referenced in
 *   process_command (0xD0 handler at line ~1668) before its definition
 *   with the PPG module (line ~2306), causing implicit-declaration
 *   error. Added forward declaration near the GLOBAL STATE block.
 * - Cleanup: swap deprecated ADC_ATTEN_DB_11 → ADC_ATTEN_DB_12
 *   (ESP-IDF notes they're identical; new name is preferred).
 *   Removed unused gpios[] in scan helper and stale
 *   ppg_jitter_window_start declaration.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.12.6:
 * - Beefed-up stuck-state recovery. v4.12.5 watchdog only cleared
 *   ppg_in_block after 2.5s of silence — it didn't touch the moving
 *   averages. When a burst of noise elevates ma_beat, the threshold
 *   (ma_beat × 1.05) becomes high enough that real beats can't cross
 *   it until the W2=33-sample (660ms) window fully decays. During
 *   that window the detector appears "stuck" — no beats emitted while
 *   real beats are visible on-screen.
 *
 *   Fix: after 3s of silence with MAb-above-floor (signal is alive),
 *   also zero the MA buffers. Detector starts fresh at the current
 *   signal level. Recovery time goes from ~1.5s to ~250ms.
 *
 * - New BLE command 0xD0 — manual detector reset. Dashboard can send
 *   this whenever it notices firmware detection is falling behind.
 *   Clears all detector state (MA buffers, in_block, run counter,
 *   last beat time). Keeps cumulative counter (beat_count_total).
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.12.5:
 * - Detector robustness pass for noisy (PC-connected) environments.
 *   Field data showed MAp toggling sample-to-sample even with the
 *   v4.12.4 narrow-bandpass filter, causing the firmware detector to
 *   miss real beats and emit false ones. Three minimal changes:
 *
 *   1. PPG_ALPHA_Q10 raised 21 → 51 (α ≈ 0.02 → 0.05). The 2% threshold
 *      margin was Elgendi-paper-optimal for clean clinical ECG. On
 *      noisy PPG the detector needs wider margin to not cross on
 *      residual HF energy. 5% is the center of the commonly cited
 *      Elgendi range for PPG (0.04-0.06).
 *
 *   2. PPG_BLOCK_ENTRY_MIN — require 2 consecutive above-threshold
 *      samples before entering in-block state. Previously a single
 *      spurious crossing entered a block, then immediately exited on
 *      the next sample, causing "toggling" between in/out. This kills
 *      the toggling directly. Real systolic peaks stay above the
 *      threshold for 5-7 samples; this requirement costs nothing for
 *      true beats.
 *
 *   3. BLE connection interval tightened. Was 40-60ms with latency=4
 *      (2 events/sec ACK'd, 5+ samples piling up per event). Now
 *      7.5-15ms with latency=0. Expected outcome: ble_err growth drops
 *      from ~5/sec to near zero, and dashboard "Gap max" should drop
 *      from ~120ms toward ~30ms. Tradeoff: slightly higher phone power
 *      use during connection, irrelevant for a wall-powered test rig
 *      or a desk session.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.12.4:
 * - Mains interference rejection. Field data from PC-connected testing
 *   revealed 60Hz powerline hash riding on the PPG signal, far stronger
 *   than battery-powered tablet testing. At 50Hz sample rate, 60Hz
 *   mains aliases to 10Hz, which WAS in the v4.12.0-3 passband (0.5-8Hz
 *   stopband wasn't tight enough to kill the alias). Two fixes:
 *
 *   1. Bandpass narrowed to 0.5-4Hz. Covers 30-240 BPM (physiological
 *      range) with comfortable margin. Much tighter stopband against
 *      mains alias. Edge detail slightly softer, but for peak DETECTION
 *      (not waveform display) this is a clear win. Recomputed scipy
 *      Butterworth coefficients accordingly.
 *
 *   2. ADC oversampling changed from MEAN to MEDIAN of 8 reads. Mean
 *      averages noise spikes in — a single 60Hz zero-crossing during
 *      the 8-read burst contaminates all 8 reads. Median rejects
 *      outliers: up to 3 of 8 reads can be mains-corrupted and the
 *      median still returns a clean sample. Cost: tiny (sort 8 ints,
 *      ~30 cycles).
 *
 * - Known residual noise path: the bodge wire on pin 11 of the QFN is
 *   inherently a small antenna. For production, route PulseSensor
 *   signal with proper trace + ground pour. For now the filter pair
 *   above makes the firmware tolerant of the noise this bodge picks
 *   up in mains-heavy environments (e.g., PC desks with USB hubs).
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.12.3:
 * - CRITICAL FIX: PPG ADC pin was wrong since v4.12.0. Defaulted to
 *   GPIO36 (SENSOR_VP) but on this PCB the PulseSensor is bodge-wired
 *   to physical pin 11 = GPIO35 (ADC1_CH7). This was the choice from
 *   the original PCB review because pin 11 has NC neighbors on both
 *   sides (GPIO34 above, 32K_XP below), making it the safest bodge
 *   target on the left edge of the QFN.
 *   Symptom: raw=0 streaming from the firmware while the detector
 *   dutifully ran on zeros. Fixed by switching PPG_ADC_GPIO to
 *   GPIO_NUM_35 and PPG_ADC_CHANNEL to ADC1_CHANNEL_7.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.12.2:
 * - Diagnostic telemetry pass. Motivated by field report that sample
 *   rate degrades from 50 Hz to ~30 Hz over a few minutes (oscillating
 *   not steady-declining), suggesting periodic CPU starvation or BLE
 *   backpressure.
 *
 * - Per-sample jitter measurement in ppg_task. Each tick records the
 *   actual delta between wake-ups and tracks max jitter over a 5-second
 *   window. Published via ble_log. If the task is being preempted we'll
 *   see jitter spikes well above 20ms.
 *
 * - ADC scan mode. BLE cmd 0xC0 0x00 enters a diagnostic mode that
 *   scans all 8 ADC1 channels (GPIO 32-39) every 500ms and emits the
 *   reads via ble_log. Lets us find which pin actually has the
 *   PulseSensor signal without reflashing. Revert with 0xC0 0x01 or
 *   reboot.
 *
 * - Task health report. Every 10 seconds, ble_log reports: free heap,
 *   min free heap, number of tasks, CPU idle percentage (from Task Watchdog
 *   idle counter), and current ppg_task high-water mark. Tells us if
 *   heap is leaking, stack is near overflow, or idle-CPU is dropping.
 *
 * - BLE send error counter. ppg_send_sample and ADC stats emit both
 *   track the return value of esp_ble_gatts_send_indicate. Errors
 *   (buffer full) are counted and reported in the health log. If BLE
 *   is backpressuring, this counter will be non-zero.
 *
 * - Raised ppg_task priority from 3 to 10 (same tier as the OTA task)
 *   to make it unambiguously higher-priority than led_task (1) and
 *   hall_task (2, when enabled). At 50Hz with a hard timing requirement
 *   this task should preempt almost everything.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.12.1:
 * - New LED_MODE_PULSE_ON_BEAT. Lens briefly flashes dark on every
 *   detected heartbeat. 150ms pulse width, 80% tint peak, cosine decay
 *   envelope. Driven by ppg_task setting a volatile deadline tick that
 *   led_task reads on its 10ms tick. BLE command 0xB6 0x00 enters this
 *   mode, replacing whatever mode was active (same pattern as A5/A6/B0).
 * - Live ADC telemetry over 0xFF03 (status characteristic) — firmware
 *   now streams periodic ADC diagnostics (every 500ms): min/max/mean of
 *   the last 25 raw ADC reads. Lets the dashboard show whether the
 *   sensor is alive at the electrical level, independent of detection.
 *   Status format byte 0 = 0xF0 (ADC_STATS), bytes 1-10 follow.
 * - BLE-echoed ESP_LOGI output. New helper ble_log() sends a formatted
 *   string on 0xFF03 with leading byte 0xF1. Dashboard parses it and
 *   shows it in a new "Firmware Log" debug tab. Lets us debug hardware
 *   issues without needing a USB serial connection.
 * - Detector: added MIN_MA_BEAT floor. When the moving-average envelope
 *   is below 4.0 (noise floor for a disconnected/dead sensor), detection
 *   is suppressed. Prevents false beats from ADC noise.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.12.0:
 * - PPG input path added. PulseSensor analog → GPIO36 (ADC1_CH0, input-only
 *   SENSOR_VP pin, so no conflict with existing PWM/hall GPIOs). 50 Hz
 *   sampling in a new ppg_task (priority 3, between led_task and hall_task).
 *   8× oversampling per sample period for noise reduction (each ADC read
 *   is ~30µs so 8× costs ~240µs of the 20ms tick — negligible).
 * - On-device detection pipeline matches the v13.1 dashboard:
 *     * 2nd-order Butterworth bandpass 0.5–8 Hz (biquad, cascaded form)
 *     * Elgendi 2013 two-moving-averages (W1=6 ~111ms, W2=33 ~667ms)
 *     * α=0.02 threshold offset (static for firmware — adaptive α and
 *       template matching are refinements the dashboard owns)
 *     * Refractory max(300ms, 0.6·IBI) as backstop
 *   Detection latency: ~100–150ms (no template lookahead, unlike v13.1).
 * - New BLE characteristic 0xFF04 (PPG stream) with notify. Packet format
 *   is 13 bytes: [type=0x02][raw_u16][idx_u16][ts_u32][flags][ibi_u16][bpm].
 *   flags bit 0 = beat, bit 1 = in_block. Stream rate = 50 Hz when a client
 *   has subscribed (CCCD write 0x0001). Off otherwise — no idle RF cost.
 * - GATTS_NUM_HANDLE 10 → 12 to accommodate the new char + CCCD.
 * - Coexists with all existing modes (strobe/static/breathe/breathe_strobe)
 *   without interaction. Future LED_MODE_PULSE_ON_BEAT (v4.13.x) will read
 *   beat events directly from a volatile set by the detector.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.11.1:
 * - BLE auto-off hardened: full BT stack teardown instead of just stopping
 *   advertising. v4.11.0 left the BT controller and Bluedroid running,
 *   which scheduled periodic housekeeping RF bursts (~1.5A spikes visible
 *   in current traces every few seconds). v4.11.1 tears down via
 *   esp_bluedroid_disable + esp_bluedroid_deinit +
 *   esp_bt_controller_disable + esp_bt_controller_deinit. Radio is cold.
 * - Added ble_stack_init() and ble_stack_teardown() helpers. Both are
 *   idempotent; state tracked via ble_stack_up flag.
 * - Re-arm path now re-initializes the full stack. Cost is ~100ms,
 *   acceptable in the user-facing latency budget (tap magnet, wait,
 *   open app, connect).
 * - Handle invalidation: gatts_if_global, service_handle, char_handles
 *   all become invalid across teardown. They get repopulated by the GATT
 *   event handler when the new GATT app registers. Code that uses these
 *   (notifications, indicate) already guards on is_connected, which is
 *   false while BLE is down.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.11.0:
 * - BLE advertising auto-off after 60 seconds of no connection. Cuts idle
 *   current from ~15mA (advertising at -6dBm, 100-200ms interval, inherited
 *   from v4.9.12) back down to ~11mA baseline when device is used standalone
 *   via hall-only. Matches the standalone-first UX that the hall program
 *   cycling (v4.10.0) is built around.
 * - Behavior: on boot or wake from deep sleep, advertising starts with a
 *   60s deadline. If no client connects, advertising is stopped via
 *   esp_ble_gap_stop_advertising(). BT controller and stack stay up so
 *   re-arming is instant. Any hall event (tap for program advance, or
 *   start of a long hold) resets the deadline and restarts advertising if
 *   it was off. While connected: deadline is disabled. On disconnect:
 *   new 60s window starts. During OTA: timeout is blocked.
 * - Trade: user must perform a hall gesture to reconnect after 60s of
 *   standalone use. Acceptable given the design intent (standalone OR
 *   connected, not both simultaneously for long periods).
 * - Note: the webapp side must be updated to handle the case where the
 *   device is running but not advertising — connect attempts will fail
 *   with "device not found," same as if it were deep-sleeping. User guidance:
 *   "tap the magnet once to wake BLE, then connect."
 * - Implementation: deadline checked in app_main 1Hz loop (already runs for
 *   session-end sleep). Single volatile tick deadline, zero new tasks.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.10.1:
 * - BLE supervision timeout 4s -> 20s. The 4-second .timeout=400 value
 *   was firing during esp_ota_begin(OTA_SIZE_UNKNOWN) partition erase
 *   (6-19s of radio silence), causing the phone to declare the link
 *   dead mid-erase and closing the connection before OTA_STATUS_READY
 *   could be sent. Symptom: "GATT operation failed" ~4s after 0xA8.
 * - 20s is well under the BLE spec limit (32s max) and still recovers
 *   quickly if the device genuinely walks out of range.
 * - No measurable power impact — supervision timeout only governs how
 *   long the central waits during anomalous silence, not normal traffic.
 * - Note: connection params are a *request* from peripheral to central.
 *   Phones may apply immediately, delay, or ignore entirely. Explains
 *   why pre-v4.10.1 OTAs worked intermittently — attempts using phone's
 *   default (often 20+ seconds) succeeded; attempts after phone applied
 *   the 4s request failed.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.10.0:
 * - Startup program changed from 10Hz strobe to 6 BPM sine breathing.
 * - Added hall-sensor program cycling. Short close (0.3s-4s) advances
 *   through three on-device programs: BREATHE, BREATHE+STROBE, STROBE.
 *   Long close (>=5s) still enters deep sleep, same as before.
 * - New LED mode LED_MODE_BREATHE_STROBE: 10Hz strobe where dark-phase
 *   duty is scaled by the breathing waveform (makes the strobe "breathe").
 *   ISR reads a volatile breathe_frac_q8 updated by led_task each 10ms tick.
 * - Hall polling moved off the 1Hz main loop into a dedicated 50ms task
 *   so 0.3s gestures are detectable. 50ms debounce on edges. Gesture is
 *   decided on release: short release = advance, 5s of continuous HIGH
 *   = sleep. 4-5s release window is dead-zone (no action).
 * - BLE commands (A5/A6/B0 etc.) still work and override the physical
 *   program. Hall advance always cycles the physical programs regardless
 *   of current BLE-set mode.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.9.12:
 * - BLE connection reliability pass, paired with webapp retry loops
 *   (controller v4.9.4, OTA v13). Addresses intermittent GATT errors
 *   that previously required multiple manual reconnect attempts.
 * - Advertising TX power: -12dBm → -6dBm. Roughly doubles link margin
 *   at the phone (+6dB ≈ 4× signal strength) so advertising packets
 *   and the connection handshake arrive well above the phone's noise
 *   floor. Biggest single contributor to unreliable first-try connects
 *   was marginal RSSI during handshake, not advertising rate.
 * - Connection TX power: remains at -12dBm. Once connected the link
 *   is established and weaker signal is sufficient — keeps per-session
 *   power draw close to v4.9.11 baseline.
 * - Advertising interval: 200-320ms → 100-200ms. Halves time between
 *   advertising events so phone scan windows align with ours sooner,
 *   cutting typical connect latency. Power cost is modest (see below).
 * - Est. idle current impact: ~+1-2mA average vs v4.9.11 (roughly
 *   +0.5-1mA from TX power bump during adv-only radio-on windows,
 *   +0.5-1mA from doubled advertising rate). Active session current
 *   essentially unchanged since connected TX stays at -12dBm.
 * - Boot banner updated to reflect new power/interval settings.
 *
 * CHANGELOG v4.9.11:
 * - AC frequency back to 100Hz (best lens charging / strongest tint)
 * - Added AC phase-sync: at each strobe clear→dark transition, AC phase is
 *   reset with alternating polarity. Every dark burst sees identical drive
 *   magnitude (no beat artifacts at any strobe freq), while alternating
 *   start polarity maintains DC balance across burst pairs.
 * - Previous versions traded tinting for beat rejection via high AC freq;
 *   phase-sync separates those concerns entirely.

/*******************************************************************************
 * PROGRAM INDICATOR (v4.14.2)
 *
 * Visual cue that tells the user which program is currently active via a
 * count of slow fade-dark pulses. Fires on every program change:
 *
 *   Hall programs (no sensor):
 *     Program 1 (BREATHE)        → 1 pulse
 *     Program 2 (BREATHE_STROBE) → 2 pulses
 *     Program 3 (STROBE)         → 3 pulses
 *
 *   PPG-auto sensor-connected handshake:
 *     5 pulses (unique "sensor detected" signal) + 3-second clear hold,
 *     then the normal PPG program 1 indicator (1 pulse) + start.
 *
 *   PPG programs (sensor connected, after handshake):
 *     PPG Program 1 (HEARTBEAT)                    → 1 pulse
 *     PPG Program 2 (COHERENCE_BREATHE)            → 2 pulses
 *     PPG Program 3 (COHERENCE_BREATHE_STROBE)     → 3 pulses
 *
 * Pulse shape: 0.5s ramp to fully tinted, 0.5s ramp back to clear.
 * Between pulses: full clear (0% duty) for 0 seconds — pulses are
 * back-to-back. This gives a clean "1 pulse per second" cadence.
 *
 * Implementation: small state machine in led_task. When pulses_remaining
 * is non-zero, indicator output OVERRIDES whatever the normal program
 * would do. When pulses_remaining drops to zero (and optional hold
 * elapses), control returns to the normal program pipeline.
 *
 * The indicator is triggered by indicator_trigger(count, hold_ms) from
 * any program-change path (hall task, ppg_auto_check, BLE command
 * handlers if desired). Idempotent — calling again overrides any
 * indicator already in progress.

 *   lens_clear_pct = (coh / 100) ^ gamma * 100

 *
 * All levels converge at coh=0 (lens dark) and coh=100 (fully clear).
 * Between, strictly monotonic: Easy >= Medium >= Hard >= Expert at
 * every coh. And ALWAYS responsive — no dead zone.

 * BLE STACK LIFECYCLE HELPERS (v4.11.0 / v4.11.1)
 *
 * Rationale: v4.9.12 changed advertising to -6dBm at 100-200ms for faster
 * first-try connects, which added ~4mA to idle current. That cost is only
 * worth paying in the window when the user actually wants to connect.
 *
 * v4.11.0 stopped advertising after BLE_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS but left the
 * controller and Bluedroid running — current traces showed residual
 * ~1.5A RF spikes from BT controller housekeeping. v4.11.1 escalates to
 * full BT stack teardown so the radio is completely cold.
 *
 * ble_stack_init():      Bring up BT controller + Bluedroid + GATT app.
 *                        Idempotent. Returns ESP_OK if already up.
 * ble_stack_teardown():  Tear down everything initialized by init().
 *                        Idempotent. Returns ESP_OK if already down.
 * ble_adv_rearm():       Ensure stack is up and advertising; reset deadline.
 *                        Called on boot, hall events, disconnect.
 * ble_adv_reset_deadline(): Push deadline out another window.
 *
 * The actual teardown trigger happens in app_main's 1Hz loop when the
 * deadline elapses, not in these helpers.
 *
 * State invariants:
 *   ble_stack_up == false  ⟹  ble_adv_active == false AND is_connected == false
 *   ble_adv_active == true ⟹  ble_stack_up == true
 *
 * Handle lifetimes: gatts_if_global, service_handle, ctrl_char_handle,
 * ota_char_handle, status_char_handle, cccd_handle all become invalid
 * across teardown and are repopulated by the GATT event handler when
 * the new GATT app registers on the next init.

 * PPG PIPELINE (v4.12.0)

 * 50 Hz PulseSensor ADC sampling → bandpass → Elgendi peak detection →
 * BLE stream on 0xFF04. Mirrors the v13.1 dashboard pipeline so client
 * and firmware produce identical beats on identical signals — useful
 * for cross-validation during integration.
 *
 * What's NOT here (owned by the dashboard instead):
 *   - Template matching (NCC against a learned beat morphology)
 *   - Kalman gating of IBIs
 *   - Self-tuning α
 * Rationale: these are refinements that catch edge cases (motion
 * artifacts, ectopic beats, drift). They cost ~400ms of lookahead
 * latency (v13.1's HALF=20 samples). For the firmware's eventual job
 * of driving the lens beat-synchronously, latency matters more than
 * PPV — a rare false beat is harmless, a 400ms-late pulse is not.
 * Dashboard still gets the raw signal and can re-run the full pipeline
 * on it for HRV analysis.

/* v4.14.22: simplified gate — AVERAGE raw ADC span over 5-second window.
 *
 * Previous v4.14.20/21 approach used a consecutive-samples counter:
 * any sample below threshold reset the counter to zero. That required
 * EVERY sample for 5 seconds to be above threshold, which real PPG
 * can't deliver — between-beat lulls naturally drop the 500ms-window
 * span below 400 transiently.
 *
 * Correct approach: compute the AVERAGE of the per-sample spans over
 * a 5-second ring buffer. If average ≥ 400 → sensor. If average < 400
 * → no sensor. Transient low-span samples get averaged out by
 * neighboring high-span samples; transient noise spikes get averaged
 * out by neighboring low noise.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   PPG_RAW_DC_MIN/MAX: unchanged, hard disconnect rail check.
 *   PPG_GATE_SPAN_MIN:  average raw ADC p-p threshold.
 *   PPG_GATE_WINDOW_N:  how many samples in the averaging window
 *                       (250 at 50Hz = 5 seconds).

 * ECG at 130Hz internally but packs 73 samples per BLE notification,
 * emitting one packet every ~500ms. One BLE conn event per packet, not
 * per sample. Connection events are the dominant radio-side power cost,
 * so this matters enormously.
 *
 * Our previous 0x02 format emitted one 13-byte packet per sample at
 * 50Hz = 50 conn events/second. Measured draw: ~60mA (vs 15mA with BLE
 * idle). Radio is the bottleneck.
 *
 * New 0x03 packet format:
 *   [0x03]               type byte
 *   [N:u8]               number of samples in this packet (typically 10)
 *   [base_ts:u32]        ms timestamp of sample[0]
 *   [sample×N]           each sample is 8 bytes:
 *     [raw:u16]          12-bit ADC reading, low 12 bits used
 *     [idx:u16]          absolute sample index
 *     [flags:u8]         bit 0 = beat, bit 1 = in_block
 *     [ibi:u16]          current IBI ms (0 if none yet)
 *     [bpm:u8]           current BPM (0 if none yet)
 *
 * Per-sample timestamp reconstruction (dashboard):
 *   sample[i].ts = base_ts + i × 20ms  (50Hz nominal)
 * If we ever need jitter accuracy we can add dt_ms per sample, but at
 * 50Hz with median oversampling the nominal 20ms interval is good
 * enough for HRV and visualization purposes.
 *
 * Size: 6 header + N × 8 = 6 + 80 = 86 bytes per batch of 10.
 * Vs 10 × 13 = 130 bytes the old way. Smaller too.
 *
 * BLE MTU: default ATT MTU 23, but ESP32 negotiates up to 517 on connect.
 * Dashboard is already receiving 18-byte coherence packets fine, so MTU
 * is already negotiated well above 86.
 *
 * Batch flush policy:
 *   - Flush when buffer hits PPG_BATCH_SIZE samples (always).
 *   - Immediate flush on subscribe (sends an empty/partial batch if any).
 *   - Immediate flush on disconnect (stops accumulating).
 *   - No early flush on beat — beats are still in the flags field of
 *     each sample, dashboard sees them within 200ms max. Coherence
 *     display latency already > 1s so nothing needs sub-200ms latency.
